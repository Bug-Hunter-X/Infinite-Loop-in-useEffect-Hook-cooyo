This repo demonstrates a common error in React's useEffect hook: an infinite loop caused by a missing dependency.  The original code (bug.js) lacks a dependency array, causing the effect to run on every render, leading to an infinite loop and potential performance issues. The solution (bugSolution.js) adds the 'count' variable to the dependency array, ensuring the effect only runs when 'count' changes. This is a crucial aspect of optimizing React components and preventing performance problems.
